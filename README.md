# Station Naming

This is a mod for `Cities: Skylines 2` that allows you naming your
transport stations, stops and city service buildings automatically.

This mod should be compatible with other auto naming mods, but you should
check the mod settings to avoid conflicts.

## Features

- Automatically name your transport stations, stops and city service buildings.
- Customizable naming rules.
- Generate names from surrounding buildings, roads, or the current district.

## Settings

Except the displayed settings, you could also customize the naming rules in the
mod setting file where it is located at 
`AppData/LocalLow/Colossal Order/Cities Skylines II/RollW_StationNaming.coc`.

You could change the naming format for the different types and set your own prefix
and suffix for the station names.

```
RollW_StationNaming
{
  "Prefix": " ", // Set the global prefix here
  "Suffix": " ", // Set the global suffix here
  // You can use the {ASSET} in the prefix or suffix to insert the asset name
  "NamingSeparator": " ", // Set the default separator between names 
  "NamedAddressNameFormat": "{NAME}, {NUMBER} {ROAD}", // Set the format for the named address name
  "AddressNameFormat": "{NUMBER} {ROAD}",
  "RoadFormat": {
    "Separator": " ", // Set the separator after the road name
    "Prefix": "", // Set the prefix for the road name only
    "Suffix": "" // Set the suffix for the road name only
  },
  "DistrictFormat": {
    "Separator": " ", // Set the separator after the district name
    "Prefix": "", // Set the prefix for the district name only
    "Suffix": "" // Set the suffix for the district name only
  }
}
```

> Note: Remember to remove the comments ("//") after you modify the settings.
