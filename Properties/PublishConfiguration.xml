# Station Naming

This is a mod for `Cities: Skylines 2` that allows you naming your
transport stations, stops and city service buildings automatically
or manually.

This mod should be compatible with other auto naming mods, but you should
check the mod settings to avoid conflicts.

## Features

- Automatically name your transport stations, stops and city service buildings.
- Customizable naming rules.
- Generate names from surrounding buildings, roads, or the current district.

## Settings

Except the displayed settings, you could also customize the naming rules in the
mod setting file where it is located at
`AppData/LocalLow/Colossal Order/Cities Skylines II/RollW_StationNaming.coc`.

For more information on how to set the name format in the setting file,
please check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roll-w/CSL2-StationNaming).

## Translations
